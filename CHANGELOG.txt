QtlMovie Change Log
===================

Version 1.12.1
- Precompiled Mac and Windows binaries use Qt 5.12.3.
- Mac and Windows installers include FFmpeg 4.1.3.
- Mac binaries are compatible with macOS 10.14 (Mojave).

Version 1.12
- Bug fix (issue #4): In batch mode, after editing a task, modified its output
  directory, closed the edit window, the output directory was reverted to the
  default when the task was edited again. This is fixed.
- Bug fix (issue #6): DVB subtitles were no longer recognized as valid for
  ffmpeg. This was due to an incompatible change in recent versions of ffprobe.
  This is fixed.
- In batch mode, when editing a task, pressing Return closes the editor.
- Precompiled Mac and Windows binaries use Qt 5.8.0.
- Mac and Windows installers include FFmpeg 3.2.4.

Version 1.11.1
- Bug fix version for Windows only. When looking for a new version, the release
  notes for the new version are fetched from SourceForge. Due to a new policy,
  SourceForge now returns files using HTTPS, not HTTP. The way QtlMovie was
  linked on Windows prevented the use of OpenSSL and HTTPS. This is fixed.
- Help files were missing from Windows standalone packages. This is fixed.

Version 1.11
- Added an option to run FFmpeg processes at a lower priority. This option is
  enabled by default. Other processes like CC Extractor and DVD Author are run
  at the normal priority since they are less CPU intensive (ie. I/O-bound, not
  CPU-bound). This option avoids reported slowness on other programs running
  on the computer.

Version 1.10
- Added an option to select the "program chain" (or "PGC") and angle to
  transcode when reading DVD content as input file. In most cases, transcoding
  the complete VOB files may work. But, with multi-PGC movies, it won't.
  With these options, transcoding a DVD movie is always safe.
- Added an option to set the DVD burning speed (passed to growisofs).
- Bug fix: The total duration of an input DVD movie was incorrectly computed as
  the sum of the durations of all PGC's. In the rare cases where a DVD movie had
  several PGC's, the duration could be wrong. This is fixed.
- The help system now uses the external browser. The style of the help files has
  been reworked in a more modern way. In the settings, each tab now has a "Help"
  button to get help on options on this tab.

Version 1.9
- Transcoding is now possible directly from an encrypted DVD. Previously,
  you had to rip the DVD using an external tool and then transcode the
  extracted files. QtlMovie now integrates libdvdcss, a public library to read
  encrypted DVD's. This means that transcoding from encrypted DVD's is possible
  on all platforms and that the decryption keys are shared with all other tools
  using libdvdcss such as the VLC media player.
- A new "DVD Extraction" option is available from the "Tools" menu. This new
  tool can extract DVD content, either as a complete ISO image, by Video Title
  Set (VTS) or individual files. This embedded tool is available on all platforms
  and can replace third-party platform-dependent DVD ripping tools.
- Limit the initial search of Closed Captions to the ffprobe duration. This was
  the previous behavior before V1.8.
- Added an option (enabled by default) to cleanup SRT/SSA/ASS subtitles files.
  This removes all invalid nul characters inside these files. It has been
  observed that some MKV files had ASS subtitles using metadata containing
  a trailing zero character. This invalid character broke ffmpeg and the
  subtitles were not burned into the video. This new option fixes this issue.
- Added an option (disabled by default) to downgrade SSA/ASS subtitles to SRT
  before insertion in the video. For SSA/ASS subtitles with weird presentation,
  this option removes the formatting.
- Bug fix: When clicking in the log window, the color of the subsequent messages
  could be incorrect. This is fixed.
- Precompiled Windows and Mac binaries use Qt 5.7.0.
- Precompiled Windows and Mac binaries use recent snapshot versions of ffmpeg.
- Precompiled Windows binaries now longer include the third party tool "DVD
  Decrypter". It is now replaced by the embedded tool "DVD Extraction".
- The support page has moved to the GitHub issue tracker at
  https://github.com/qtlmovie/qtlmovie/issues

Version 1.8
- Improved US Closed Captions (EIA-608, CEA-708) detection and processing
  using CCextractor version 0.80.
- Added an option to "capitalize" (suppress ALL CAPS) in US Closed Captions.
- Windows and Mac installers include CCextractor 0.80 binaries.
- Fedora and Ubuntu packages for CCextractor 0.80 are available on QtlMovie
  SourceForge project (and required to install QtlMovie 1.8).
- Removed dependency on Telxcc as an independent application. Telxcc is
  no longer maintained. Telxcc has been removed from the Windows and Mac
  installers. The Fedora and Ubuntu packages no longer depend on telxcc.
  QtlMovie now performs Teletext extraction internally, using some code
  from Telxcc. Many thanks to Petr Kutalek for having developed Telxcc.

Version 1.7
- When encoding for NTSC DVD's, now use 29.97 f/s instead of 30 previously.
- Added support for iPhone SE and iPad Pro screen sizes.
- Added support for Android devices. The generated encoding format is the
  same as iOS devices. Added support for some popular devices screen sizes.

Version 1.6.1
- Bug fix on Mac OS X installer. With version 1.6, QtlMovie failed to start
  on some Mac's with error "could not find or load the Qt platform plugin
  cocoa". This is fixed.
- Updated logo to a more modern flat design style one.

Version 1.6
- QtlMovie is available on Mac OS X. The .dmg package contains precompiled
  versions of all media tools and is self-sufficient, like its Windows
  counter-part. QtlMovie 1.6 has been tested on Mac OS X 10.11 "El Capitan".
  Feedbacks on older versions are welcome.
- Bug fix: Converting to H.264 (iPad, iPhone) failed when the input video
  had chroma format 4:2:2 (as found in MJPEG files from some photo cameras).
  This is fixed (output format now forced to 4:2:0).
- Bug fix: In batch mode, when the output file was modified to a non-default
  value, it was reset to the default value when the file was edited again.
  This is fixed.
- Bug fix: In file name edit boxes, when the file name was edited and the
  cursor arrived to 2 adjacent backslashes, the cursor jumped to the end
  of line. This is fixed.
- Removed new spurious messages from FFmpeg 3.0.x.
- Precompiled Windows binary uses Qt 5.6.0.
- Windows installer includes FFmpeg 3.0.1.
- Mac installer includes FFmpeg 3.0.2.

Version 1.5.1
- Bug fix: When using drag & drop of input files in batch mode, the error
  "no output file selected" was reported if the tasks were not edited first.
  This is fixed.
- Windows installer includes FFmpeg 2.8.4.

Version 1.5
- Adaptive bitrate computation for AVI, iPhone, iPad. Previously, one bitrate
  value was defined for iPhone, one for iPad and one for AVI. But, when the
  screen size was changed (change iPad model for instance), the same bitrate
  was used, which is not appropriate and needed manual adjustment. Moreover,
  on iPad, iPhone and AVI, the screen size is a maximum bounding box, not an
  actual output size. When the original video is smaller than the screen size,
  the image is not resized and the bandwidth was too high for the size. Now
  the settings no longer specify a "bit rate" but a "video quality" which is
  is a number of bits per pixel per 100 frames. The actual bitrate is computed
  from the actual output image size and this video quality indicator.
- Bug fix: On iPhone, the iPad video bitrate was used instead of the iPhone
  one. This is fixed with adaptive bitrate.
- Bug fix: In the very specific case when a DVD was converted into a DVD-MPEG
  file and a subtitle track was selected and the original size of the video was
  exactly 720x576, then the subtitles were not inserted. This is fixed.
- More reliable checking of new version online.
- Windows installer includes FFmpeg 2.8.3.

Version 1.4
- Added the ability to drag and drop several files in the main window
  in batch mode. This automatically creates one task per file.
- Added an option to specify the default output type (DVD, iPad, etc.)
- Added options to disable the automatic selection of original audio
  track with subtitles.
- Precompiled Windows binary uses Qt 5.5.1.
- Windows installer includes FFmpeg 2.8.1.

Version 1.3.1
- Automatically detect the default DVD burner if not specified in the
  settings (Windows and Linux only).
- In the settings, the selection of existing DVD burners is proposed in
  a combo box instead of a free-form text line edit (Windows and Linux only).
  If no DVD burner is found, keep the traditional free edit / browse
  selection for the burner (in case QtlMovie missed the actual device).
- Accept more than one input file in the command line (for batch mode).
- Added command line option "-d" to initially activate the debug messages.
- Prevent editing a task while it is running.
- Bug fix: In batch mode, when editing a completed task, no longer complain
  that the existing output file will be overwritten.
- Bug fix: In batch mode, the background color of the running job was
  sometimes dashed, sometimes not. This is fixed.
- Bug fix: When an error occured during the start of a transcoding job
  (for instance if the output file was not specified), subsequent jobs
  always failed with "Internal error, transcoding job already created".
  This is fixed.
- Tested OK on Windows 10.

Version 1.3
- Added a "multi-file batch mode" which allows the processing of multiple
  files in sequence. The main window shows a list of files to be processed.
  The transcoding operation processes all files in the list. Adding other
  files to process is allowed during the transcoding of the previous files.
  By default, QtlMovie uses its classical "single file mode", where all
  transcoding options are directly accessible in one-click in the main
  window. It is possible to switch between the two modes using the "Tools"
  menu or the settings. Using the classical single file mode remains the
  easiest solution but the batch mode is uselful when many files need to
  be transcoded. The user can define all the planned conversions and then
  let all the conversions work for hours.
- New options for:
  - Automatically clear the log panel before starting transcoding.
  - Automatically save the log panel at the transcoding completion.
  - FFprobe execution timeout in seconds. Setting a larger value may be
    useful when the input file is on a slow DVD drive.
- The format of the saved settings has changed and now uses a more native
  format. On Windows, the settings are saved in the registry. On Unix and
  Linux, they are saved in $HOME/.config/QtlMovie/QtlMovie.conf. Settings
  from the previous versions of QtlMovie (if present) are converted to the
  new format the first time QtlMovie 1.3 is run. The converted settings
  file is kept for reference into the user's home directory as .qtlmovie.old
  but is no longer used and may be manually deleted.
- Bug fix: In the specific combination where the input was a DVD with
  multiple VOB's and the output was a DVD MPEG file, only one VOB was
  processed. This is fixed.
- Bug fix: The "forced display aspect ratio" was not always enforced.
  This is fixed.
- Bug fix: On Windows (case-insensitive file systems), the default output file
  could clash with the input file if they differed by letter case only. Now add
  the .transcoded suffix, as with identical input and output files.
- Bug fix: Sometimes, the deletion of temporary files failed, maybe due to a
  race condition with terminating processes. This is (probably) fixed.
- When editing DVD Burner settings on Windows, now browse directly to the
  "Computer" virtual folder. This is now possible thanks to Qt 5.5.
- Added support for iPhone 6 and 6 Plus.
- Precompiled Windows binary uses Qt 5.5.0.
- Windows installer includes FFmpeg 2.7.

Version 1.2.16
- Save the size and position of all windows. Useful for screens with a size or
  resolution which are not well suited for the default geometry of the
  application windows. Resize once and keep the same size and position forever.
- Precompiled Windows binary uses Qt 5.3.0.
- Windows installer includes FFmpeg 2.2.2.
- Ubuntu 14.04 LTS .deb package is now built for QtlMovie. Be sure to read the
  user documentation for a description of how to install FFmpeg on Ubuntu.
- Ubuntu packages for CCextractor 0.69 and telxcc 2.5.3 are available on
  QtlMovie SourceForge project.

Version 1.2.15
- Added an optional sound notification at the end of the transcoding process.
  Must be enabled in the Settings / Transcoding tab.
- Windows installer includes FFmpeg 2.2.1 and CCextractor 0.69.
- Linux RPM's for CCextractor 0.69 is available on QtlMovie SourceForge project.

Version 1.2.14
- Added the possibility to force a new display aspect ratio. Useful when the
  input file is, for example, incorrectly labeled as 4:3 while it should be 16:9.
- Linux RPM package for Fedora 20.
- Precompiled Windows binary uses Qt 5.2.1.
- Windows installer includes FFmpeg 2.1.4, CCextractor 0.68 and telxcc 2.5.3.
- Linux RPM's for CCextractor 0.68 and telxcc 2.5.3 are available on QtlMovie
  SourceForge project (Fedora 20).

Version 1.2.13
- Display full translated language names (when available) for audio and
  subtitle tracks instead of language codes.
- On Windows, the progress bar overlay on the application icon is no longer
  used for Windows versions prior to Windows 7. Crashes were reported on Vista
  when the application exits (maybe a Qt 5.2.0 problem).

Version 1.2.12
- Fixed a performance problem during the initial audio level analysis when
  audio normalization was required.
- Prebuilt Windows binary uses Qt 5.2.0 final.

Version 1.2.11
- Use the "rotate" metadata from the input file to apply the corresponding
  rotation on video. This is useful for video files from an iPhone which
  are sometimes upside down, depending on the iPhone orientation at the
  time the video was shot. Can be disabled in the settings.
- Added "iPhone" output type. Same kind of conversion as iPad but size
  and bitrate parameters are different.
- Video frame rate for iPad and iPhone is now 30 f/s instead of 25.

Version 1.2.10
- Added audio normalization. Not enabled by default, edit settings first.
  See help on audio settings for more details.
- Reorganized "Edit Settings" tabs.
- Fixed a problem with option -threads in ffmpeg.
- On Windows with Aero desktop, added a progress bar on the application icon.
  Require Qt 5.2 or higher.
- Fixed a problem when searching for a new version behind one specific brand
  of proxy server (did not like the default Qt User-Agent).
- Integrated official FFmpeg 2.1.1 with Windows installer.
- Prebuilt Windows binary uses Qt 5.2.0-rc1.
- Provide a RPM package for QtlMovie on Fedora Linux. Added scripts to build
  custom RPM packages for ccextractor and telxcc which do not have packages
  in standard repositories.

Version 1.2.9 (2013-11-03)
- Added "AVI" output type for highly compressed file storage and exchange.
- Integrated official FFmpeg 2.1 with Windows installer.
- Windows installer is now internationalized.
- Windows executable is now statically linked and the installer no longer
  embeds Qt DLL's. The installer is smaller and the risk to miss required
  new DLL's is reduced.

Version 1.2.8 (2013-10-27)
- Fixed a performance problem when opening a file without Closed Captions. The
  search for the presence of CC delayed the display of the other streams. Now,
  all other streams are displayed at once. The (unsuccessful) search for CC
  completes in the background.
- Added a "release notes" viewer from menu "Help".

Version 1.2.7 (2013-10-26)
- Help files are now fully translated. QtlMovie can work completely in another
  language. Current translations are English and French. Native speakers will
  be required for additional languages.

Version 1.2.6 (2013-10-22)
- Bug fix: On Windows, if the output file name contained a single quote (')
  and text subtitles from the input file were inserted in the output file,
  the conversion failed. Fixed.
- Fixed typos in help files and translations.
- Added check for a new version either when the application starts (can be
  disabled in the settings) or manually from the "Help" menu.

Version 1.2.5 (2013-10-21)
- US Closed Captions subtitles (CEA-608/708) are now supported thanks to
  the integration of CCExtractor. Currently, the CC are numbered as follow:
  1: channel 1, field 1, 2: channel 1, field 2, 3: channel 2, field 1,
  4: channel 2, field 2. This may not be ideal. Feedback from US users required.
- Bug fix: On Windows, enforce the DVD burner device to be a drive name.

Version 1.2.4 (2013-10-19)
- Encoding for DVD now transcodes audio to AC-3 instead of MPEG-2 Audio Layer 2.
- When encoding for DVD, if the input video stream is already DVD-compliant,
  do not re-encode video. Simply re-encode audio and remux. This is useful
  for video files from analog-to-digital acquisition cards which produce
  DVD-compliant files with MPEG-2 audio instead of AC-3. Previously, the
  re-encoding was skipped only if the complete file was DVD_compliant.
- Automatic detection DVD-compliant files (full file or video only) can be
  disabled in the settings. This is useful to force a transcoding when the
  file seems DVD-compliant but is not really (too large for instance).
- QtlMovie is now internationalized. The current only maintained translation
  is French. Looking for volunteers for other languages. Help files are not
  yet translated. The system locale is used by default (when supported by
  QtlMovie). Another locale can be specified on the command line. Example:
  "QtlMovie -l en" starts in English.
- Bug fix: When editing the input or output file name, the cursor jumped to
  the end of line after each character. Fixed.

Version 1.2.3 (2013-10-16)
- Bug fix: "Test Audio" feature was not working well. Fixed.
- Workaround for a bug in ffmpeg on Windows: When the option -passlogfile
  contains non-ASCII characters, the path of the log file as built by
  ffmpeg is wrong and ffmpeg fails with "no such file or directory".
  Now use the DOS 8.3 short path of the temporary directory for
  temporary ffmpeg pass log files.

Version 1.2.2 (2013-10-14)
- Bug fix: When a file was dragged/dropped into the edit box for input file,
  output file or subtitle file and not otherwise edited, the application was
  not properly notified and the file was ignored.
- Added settings to specify the video bitrate for iPad. The default value
  remains 2.5 Mb/s.
- Added settings to specify the iPad screen size (iPad 1/2/mini vs. iPad 3/4).
- Windows installer now integrates official telxcc v 2.5.1 (required to support
  M2TS files, previous version of QtlMovie used a patched version of telxcc).

Version 1.2.1 (2013-10-12)
- Added settings to create NTSC or PAL DVD.

Version 1.2.0 (2013-10-11)
- Improved help files.
- Support M2TS input files.
- Fixed deployment problem on Windows.
  The Qt DLL's which were copied still referenced the hardcoded path the Qt
  build environment. Now the installer includes the required Qt plugins.
